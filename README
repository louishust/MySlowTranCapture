MySlowTransactionCapture - A tool to print MySQL transactions that take 
more than <n> milliseconds

Reasons for developing this tool was described here: http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2011/04/tracking-long-running-transactions-in.html
 
How to use:
* Install libpcap, libpcap-devel, boost, and boost-devel if not installed
* make
* make install
* Run myslowtrancapture
--
[root]# myslowtrancapture -i bond0

Tips:

* Use -i "interface name" to listen to specific NIC.
--- example ---
[root]# myslowtrancapture -i eth1
Monitoring eth1 interface..
Listening port 3306..
Logging transactions that take more than 4000 milliseconds..
---------------

* Use -l port to listen to specific port.
Filtering syntax is the same as that of tcpdump.
--- example ---
[root]# myslowtrancapture -l 5508
Monitoring any interface..
Filtering rule: tcp port 5508
Logging transactions that take more than 4000 milliseconds..
---------------

* Use -t milliseconds to change printing criteria.
--- example ---
[root]# myslowtrancapture -i eth0 -t 10000
Monitoring eth0 interface..
Listening port 3306..
Logging transactions that take more than 10000 milliseconds..
---------------

* Use -o when your MySQL server speaks old MySQL protocols.
--- example ---
[root]# myslowtrancapture -i eth0 -t 10000 -o
Monitoring eth0 interface..
Listening port 3306..
Logging transactions that take more than 10000 milliseconds..
Capturing MySQL old protocols..
---------------

* Use -u -H -P -p to store the result to database

Limitations:
* Implicit commit by DDL is not supported (not handled as transaction ends).
* MySQL Server-Side Prepared Statement protocol is not supported.
